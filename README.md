# aframe-recorder
Recording component for A-Frame using MediaRecorder

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This component is compatible with A-Frame 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7

### Usage

To use this component, include the component as follows

```html
<script src="https://aframe.io/releases/0.6.1/aframe.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://rawgit.com/archilogic-com/aframe-recorder/master/a-recorder.js"></script>
<a-scene>
  <a-entity recorder="recording.webm"></a-recorder>
  <!-- insert the rest of your a-scene -->
</a-scene>
```

To start recording, you can either

* send a `start` event to the component or
* use `document.querySelector('[recorder]').components.recorder.start()`

To end the recording, you can either

* send a `stop` event to the component or
* use `document.querySelector('[recorder]').components.recorder.stop()`
